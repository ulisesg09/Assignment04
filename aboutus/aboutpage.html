                        My name is Ulises Gutierrez; I am from a small town near Fresno called Parlier. I drive to Fresno State everyday, and I am attending the university for a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration with an emphasis on Computer Information Systems. Additionally, i am contemplating on whether i should also strive to get a bachelors in the subject of construction management.  I am currently employed by the DISCOVERe program as a DISCOVERe GUIDE. I am extremely motivated to take this course since it is required for my major, and I believe that this is an area in which I personally need improvement on.
